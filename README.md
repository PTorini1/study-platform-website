# Eductech ü¶ùüêß

Project made for the second semester of System Development course in SENAI Manuel Garcia Filho.

We had to develop a responsive platform for schools to make things easier between students and teachers.

In this platform teachers can send homeworks, alerts and didatic material. The students can see teachers' posts and talk to them using the chat besides practice the  exercises using our laboratory.

All of these functionalities are actually working, it's not just illustrative.

As we're supposed to use Python, we chose Flask as our framework.

This website has been put in Heroku for a short time, but it's not there anymore for money questions :)

I helped with the front-end development in some pages like home, profile edition and chat. 
With the back-end I helped with profile register and edition, chat, profile photo using camera and put the project in Heroku using a cloud database.

Project Group: @rafaelleitedasilva, @LuanPereira2005, @zMSLz, @Holanda22, @evrocha, @Sarasouss, @Hyzark and me.
