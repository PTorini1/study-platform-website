# Eductech ü¶ùüêß

Project made for the second semester of System Development course in SENAI Manuel Garcia Filho.

We had to develop a responsive platform for schools to make things easier between students and teachers. In this platform teachers can send homeworks, alerts and didatic material. The students can see teachers' posts and talk to them using the chat besides practice the exercises using our laboratory.

All of these functionalities are actually working, it's not just illustrative. As we're supposed to use Python, we chose Flask as our framework. This website has been put in Heroku for a short time, but it's not there anymore for money questions :)

I'll let here some pictures of the project. If you want to run this project in your machine, you can run the commands found in "comandos_uteis.txt" file after clone it.

Project Group: @rafaelleitedasilva, @LuanPereira2005, @zMSLz, @Holanda22, @evrocha, @Sarasouss, @Hyzark and me.
